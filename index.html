# blog
In this project, I have created the frontend of a blog. 
This is the HTML part : 

<!DOCTYPE html>

            In the 1940s, there was a man who, at the age of 65, was living off
            of $99 social security checks in a small house, driving a beat-up
            car. He decided it was time to make a change, so he thought about
            what he had to offer that other people may benefit from. His mind
            went to his fried chicken recipe, which his friends and family
            loved. He left his home state of Kentucky and traveled throughout
            the country, trying to sell his recipe to restaurants. He even
            offered the recipe for free, asking for only a small chunk of the
            money that was earned. However, most of the restaurants declined his
            offer. In fact, 1,009 restaurants said no. But even after all of the
            rejections, he persisted. He believed in himself and his chicken
            recipe. When he visited restaurant #1,010, he got a YES.

            A wise man once faced a group of people who were complaining about
            the same issues over and over again. One day, instead of listening
            to the complaints, he told them a joke and everyone cracked up
            laughing. Then, the man repeated the joke. A few people smiled.
            Finally, the man repeated the joke a third time–but no one reacted.
            The man smiled and said, “You won’t laugh at the same joke more than
            once. So what are you getting from continuing to complain about the
            same problem?”

            A mother camel and her baby were lying down, soaking up the sun. The
            baby camel asked his mom, “Why do we have these big bumps on our
            back?” The mom stopped to think and then said, “We live in the
            desert where there is not much water available. Our humps store
            water to help us survive on long journeys. “ The baby camel then
            stopped to think and said, “Well, why do we have long legs with
            rounded feet?” His mother replied, “They are meant to help us walk
            through sand.” The baby asked a third question, “Why are my
            eyelashes so long?” The mother replied, “Your long eyelashes offer
            you protection from sand when it blows in the wind.” Finally, the
            baby said, “If we have all of these natural abilities given to us to
            walk through the desert, what’s the use for camels in the Zoo?”

            There was once a man who lived with his three sons. His sons were
            hard workers, but they constantly fought with each other. Even
            though the man continuously tried to help his sons make peace with
            each other, he was never successful. In fact, their fighting got to
            a point where their neighbors would make fun of them. Eventually,
            the father became ill. He begged his sons to learn how to work
            together because of his impending death, but they didn’t listen. The
            father then decided to teach his sons a practical lesson to help his
            sons forget their differences and become a united team. The father
            called his sons and said, “I’ll give you each an equal collection of
            sticks to break in half. Whoever breaks the sticks the fastest will
            be rewarded.” After agreeing to the task, the father gave each of
            his sons 10 sticks and instructed them to break each stick in half.
            This task took the sons mere minutes to complete, but once they were
            finished, they started to fight about who finished first. The father
            said, “Dear sons, the task isn’t finished. Now I’ll give each of you
            10 more sticks, however, you must break the sticks in half as a
            bundle rather than snapping each one separately.” His sons agreed
            and attempted to do what he had asked. They each tried their best,
            but none could break the bundle in half. They told their father that
            they had failed. In response, their father said, “See, it was easy
            to break the sticks in half individually, but you couldn’t break all
            10 of them at the same time. Similarly, if the three of you stay
            united as a team, nobody will be able to harm you. However, if you
            fight all the time, anyone will be able to defeat you. Please come
            together as a united team.” This lesson helped the man’s sons
            understand the power of being a team and promised their father that,
            moving forward, they would work together as a team, no matter what
            the situation was.
